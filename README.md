LINKED LIST

Enter choice: 1, Enter value to insert: 2, Inserted 2 into list → The value 2 is added at the end of the list (first node).

Enter choice: 1, Enter value to insert: 5, Inserted 5 into list → The value 5 is added at the end of the list (after 2).

Enter choice: 3, List contents: 2 5 → The list is displayed from the first node to last → 2 5.

Enter choice: 2, Deleted: 2 → The first node (head) with value 2 is removed, leaving only 5 in the list.

CIRCULAR LINKED LIST

Enter choice: 1, Enter value to insert: 2, Inserted 2 into circular list
→ Value 2 is inserted; since it’s the first node, it points back to itself (circular).

Enter choice: 1, Enter value to insert: 5, Inserted 5 into circular list
→ Value 5 is added at the end, so the list is now 2 → 5 → back to 2.

Enter choice: 3, Circular list contents: 2 5
→ Displaying starts at the first node 2, then continues until it loops back, showing 2 5.

Enter choice: 2, Deleted: 2
→ The first node (head) with value 2 is removed; now the head becomes 5, which points back to itself.
